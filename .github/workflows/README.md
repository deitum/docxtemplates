Dependency bumps are proposed by Dependabot, configured in
[`../dependabot.yml`](../dependabot.yml): npm weekly (dev-dependency minor and
patch updates grouped into one PR), GitHub Actions monthly.

> **The two security workflows only run on a public repository.** Both code
> scanning and the dependency graph they rely on require GitHub Advanced
> Security when the repository is private, so on a private repository they can
> only ever fail. Each job is guarded with
> `if: ${{ !github.event.repository.private }}` and reports as _skipped_
> instead; making the repository public re-enables them with no further changes.

## `ci.yml`

Three independent jobs, so a formatting slip doesn't hide a test failure:

- **lint** — `npm run lint`, `npm run format:check`, `npm run typecheck`.
- **test** — `npm test` on Node 20, 22 and 24 on Ubuntu, plus Node 22 on
  Windows. `fail-fast: false`, so one red cell doesn't cancel the rest. The
  Windows cell is there because the tests build filesystem paths and the repo
  enforces LF endings (`linebreak-style: unix`); both are things that only break
  on Windows.
- **build** — `npm run build`, then `npm run check:package`, which runs
  `publint --strict` and `attw` over an actual `npm pack` tarball. This is the
  job that catches a broken `exports` map, a missing declaration file, or a
  `dist/` entry point that doesn't resolve.

Everything mirrors `npm run verify`, so a failure here reproduces locally with
one command.

Runs are grouped by ref with `cancel-in-progress: true` — pushing again to a
branch cancels the superseded run.

## `release.yml`

Releases are driven by [changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)
(config in [`../../.changeset/config.json`](../../.changeset/config.json)). The
workflow has two modes, and `changesets/action` picks between them automatically:

1. **Changesets are pending** → it opens or updates a `chore: version packages`
   pull request that applies the version bumps, rewrites `CHANGELOG.md` and
   refreshes `package-lock.json` (`npm run changeset:version`).
2. **No changesets pending** (i.e. that PR has just been merged) → it runs
   `npm run release` (`changeset publish`), which publishes any version not yet
   on the registry and pushes the git tag.

So: merging a feature PR never publishes; merging the version PR does.

### Required setup

- **`NPM_TOKEN`** repository secret — an npm automation token with publish
  rights on the `@deitum` scope. Nothing else is needed; `GITHUB_TOKEN` is
  provided by Actions.
- **Workflow permissions** — the job requests `contents: write` and
  `pull-requests: write` to push the version PR, and `id-token: write` for npm
  [provenance](https://docs.npmjs.com/generating-provenance-statements).
  Provenance is enabled through `publishConfig.provenance` in `package.json`;
  without `id-token: write` the publish step fails.
- In repository settings, Actions must be allowed to create pull requests.

Unlike the other workflows this one uses `cancel-in-progress: false`: cancelling
a publish halfway through is worse than running it twice.

## Adding a workflow

Keep the conventions the existing ones follow, since they are what makes these
files boring to review:

- Declare a least-privilege top-level `permissions:` block (start from
  `contents: read` and add per job only what that job needs).
- Set a `concurrency:` group.
- Pin actions to a major tag (`actions/checkout@v4`); Dependabot keeps them
  current.
- Take the Node version from `.nvmrc` via `node-version-file` rather than
  hard-coding it, except in the test matrix where the version is the point.
- Use `cache: npm` on `actions/setup-node` and install with `npm ci`.
